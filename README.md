# üé¨ Movies App

The **Movies App** is a desktop application built using **WPF** (Windows Presentation Foundation).  
It allows users to manage their movie collection with ease, following the **MVVM** (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture.  

The app uses **MSSQL LocalDB** for data persistence, with a responsive UI designed in **XAML**.  
This application showcases basic **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations that are fully persisted in the local database.
